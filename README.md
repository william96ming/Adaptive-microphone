# adaptive-microphone
This design is a adaptive microphone. The system detects and tracks the primary source of sound in a room and adaptively fouces the microphone toward in the direction of the speaker.


The system collects the timing data from 3/4 sound sensors. And process the data based on the equation (sound travel distance = sound velocity * travel time).
